Overview
========

luufs is a lazy man's, user-mode union file system.

It takes two directories and creates a magical directory which shows their
unified contents.

luufs is a "compile once, run anywhere" alternative for Aufs
(http://aufs.sourceforge.net/) and Unionfs (http://unionfs.filesystems.org/),
implemented in user-mode via FUSE (http://fuse.sourceforge.net/).

However, luufs is very simple, so it does not fit in all use cases of more
complex union file systems. It operates according to three rules:
  1) The first directory is read-only and the second one is writeable. New files
     are created under the writeable directory, but read from both directories.
  2) If a file exists under both directories, the one under the read-only
     directory is preferred. This improves security, as files (e.g /bin/login)
     cannot be overwritten using external access to the writeable directory.
  3) Non-root processes cannot open new file descriptors via luufs (e.g open
     files), but can use existing file descriptors.

Therefore, luufs can be used to secure servers: they can be trapped under a
luufs mount point (using chroot), with a writeable directory mounted with the
MS_NOEXEC and MS_NODEV flags.
